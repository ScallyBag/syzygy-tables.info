    <h2>DTZ<sub>50</sub>&prime;&prime; with rounding</h2>

    <p>Once a tablebase position has been reached, the <em>Distance To Zeroing</em>
      (of the fifty-move counter by a capture or pawn move)
      can be used to reliably make progress in favorable positions and stall
      in unfavorable positions.</p>

    <p>The precise meanings are as follows:</a>

    <p>A DTZ value <var>n</var> with 100 &ge; <var>n</var> &ge; 1 means the position is winning, and a zeroing
      move or checkmate can be forced in <var>n</var> or <var>n</var> + 1 half-moves.</p>

    <a href="/?fen=1kb5/8/1KN5/3N4/8/8/8/8_b_-_-_0_1"><img width="300" height="300" alt="" src="https://backscattering.de/web-boardimage/board.svg?fen=1kb5/8/1KN5/3N4/8/8/8/8&check=b8"></a>

    <p>For an example of this ambiguity, see how the DTZ repeats after the only-move Ka8 in
      <a href="/?fen=1kb5/8/1KN5/3N4/8/8/8/8_b_-_-_0_1">1kb5/8/1KN5/3N4/8/8/8/8 b - -</a>.
      This is due to the fact that some Syzygy tables store rounded moves
      instead of half-moves, to save space. This implies some primary tablebase lines
      may waste up to 1 ply. Rounding is never used for endgame phases where it would
      change the game theoretical outcome (WDL<sub>50</sub>).</p>

    <p>Users need to be careful in positions
      that are nearly drawn under
      the 50-move rule! Carelessly wasting 1 more ply
      by not following the tablebase recommendation, for a total of 2 wasted plies,
      may change the outcome of the game.
    </p>

    <p>A DTZ value <var>n</var> &gt 100 means the position is winning, but drawn under the 50-move rule.
      A zeroing move or checkmate can be forced in <var>n</var> half-moves, or in <var>n</var> - 100 half-moves
      if a later phase is responsible for the win.</p>

    <a href="/?fen=8/8/2N5/8/3k4/7N/p2K4/8_b_-_-_0_1"><img width="300" height="300" alt="" src="https://backscattering.de/web-boardimage/board.png?fen=8/8/2N5/8/3k4/7N/p2K4/8&check=d4"></a>

    <p>
      For example, in <a href="/?fen=8/8/2N5/8/3k4/7N/p2K4/8_b_-_-_0_1">8/8/2N5/8/3k4/7N/p2K4/8 b - -</a>
      black promotes the pawn in 7 ply, but the DTZ is 107,
      indicating that white can hold a draw under the 50-move rule in a later phase of the endgame.</p>
